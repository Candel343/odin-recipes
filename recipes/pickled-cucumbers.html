        <p>For these pickled cucumbers, 2 main ingredients and some brine is all you need to have fresh pickles in a day. 
        They are great on their own, on a burger, or sloppy Joe. I personally like to sandwich one in between 2 plain potato chips for a snack. The recipe can be easily halved.</p>
