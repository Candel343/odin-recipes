    <p>Baked tomato slices are a simple and versatile dish, perfect as a <em>flavorful</em> side or a light main course. 
    The essence of the recipe involves slicing fresh tomatoes, seasoning them, and baking them until tender and lightly browned.
    At its core, the dish consists of ripe, firm tomatoes sliced to a uniform thickness, typically around a quarter to a half-inch.
    This ensures even cooking. Varieties like beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes are often recommended because their size and sturdiness
    hold up well during baking.</p>
    <p>The preparation is straightforward. Sliced tomatoes are arranged on a baking sheet, often lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
    A drizzle of good quality olive oil is essential, adding flavor and helping the tomatoes to roast.[1] Basic seasonings always include 
    salt and pepper, but from there, a wide array of herbs and spices can be used to customize the flavor. Garlic, in either fresh 
    or powdered form, is a common addition, as are fresh or dried herbs like basil, oregano, and rosemary.</p>
